# 👋 Hi, I'm Mattia Jorgen Prugnoli

💻 **Full Stack Developer** at [Snap4City](https://www.snap4city.org)  
🌍 Building **Smart City & IoT** platforms that turn data into insight  
⚡ Passionate about **real-time systems**, **urban data**, and **open-source innovation**

### 🚀 About Me
I'm a computer engineer working on the full software stack — from backend APIs and data pipelines to front-end dashboards and mobile interfaces.  
At Snap4City, I help shape a platform that integrates thousands of IoT devices, city datasets, and analytics workflows into tools used by citizens, researchers, and municipalities.

I believe great code should **simplify complexity** — especially when that complexity is an entire city.
